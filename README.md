## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

The biggest part of this project was learning how to use multiple React components at the same time and including different states for variables to be passed between the multiple components. It's hard for me to visualize the layout of components together, so I will continue to practice with React.
